## Reversing an array of integers

```
// Reversing an array on integers
/*
array[1,2,3,4]
a = 0, b.count - 1, c = 0
c = a
a = b
c = b
a += 1 && b -= 1
*/
func reversingArray(array: [Int])->[Int]?{
    var array = array
    var first = 0
    var last = array.count - 1
    while first < last {
        let holder = array[first]
        array[first] = array[last]
        array[last] = holder

        first += 1
        last -= 1
        }
    return array
}
